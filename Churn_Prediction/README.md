# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to leave the company.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features such as:
- CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer.
- Gender, Age, Tenure, etc.: Customer demographics.
- MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges: Charges information.
- Churn: Target variable indicating if the customer has churned.

## Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Handling missing values.
    - Encoding categorical variables.
    - Feature scaling.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Visualizing the distribution of features.
    - Analyzing correlations between features and the target variable.

3. Model Building:
    - Training various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
    - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Model Evaluation:
    - Comparing different models.
    - Selecting the best model based on evaluation metrics.
