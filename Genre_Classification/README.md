# Movie Genre Classification

## Project Overview
This project involves classifying movies into different genres based on their plot summaries using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset includes movie plot summaries and their corresponding genres.

## Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Text cleaning and normalization.
    - Tokenization and stemming.
    - Converting text data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Visualizing the distribution of genres.
    - Analyzing common words and phrases in different genres.

3. Model Building:
    - Training various machine learning models like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest.
    - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Model Evaluation:
    - Comparing different models.
    - Selecting the best model based on evaluation metrics.
